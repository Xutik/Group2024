# Group project
### Tech stack: 
Set up node.js, webpack, eslint, prettier. Be mindful that config files for these will be committed to the repository and shared between all project members. 
### Architecture: 
Create your ‘projects’ as an array of objects. Each project object can have properties for its title, programming languages, author, tags, links, etc. Consider a "featured" tag as a boolean property on your projects,  to implement styling changes if you have many projects and want to highlight some of them with unique styling.
### Workflows: 
Observe software development principles and achieve separation of concerns. Structure your project in terms of modules which live in specific files, so that team members can make contributions without writing in the same file and avoid merge conflicts. Be careful with CSS variable naming and scopes too.
### Inspiration: 
Search YouTube and other social media for “studio websites”, “portfolio websites”, “developer portfolio”, etc. Check out Pinterest, Dribbble, Cosmos, Behance, Instagram for web and UI design examples.
